# Overview

During a Python-based project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The primary objective was to identify the key factors that influenced customers' decisions to subscribe to bank term deposits. Leveraging my expertise in data preprocessing and visualization, I extracted valuable insights from the dataset and transformed them into visually appealing and easy-to-understand data visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard. By utilizing advanced visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I effectively communicated complex information and facilitated the interpretation of crucial findings. This project not only showcased my proficiency in data analysis and preprocessing but also demonstrated my ability to align with the core responsibilities of a data analyst.
